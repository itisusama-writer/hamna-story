### **Act 1 – The Setup (Normal → Disturbance)**

1. **University Life Introduction**

   * Introduce Humna, her life at Erohal University, her closeness with her sister Maleeha, and best friend Eman.
   * Show snippets of her normal hostel routine (classes, laughter, late-night chai, study groups).
   * Drop **subtle hints** of her unease (checking her phone nervously, deleting posts, avoiding strangers staring).

2. **First Encounters with A.S (Secret Admirer)**

   * Anonymous messages begin (“Darling, can I be your favorite?”).
   * Humna and her friends brush it off as a prank at first.
   * A.S grows bolder: commenting on things Humna hasn’t posted yet (proving he’s watching her physically).

3. **Shift in Atmosphere**

   * Humna feels suffocated in the first hostel, fearing her privacy is invaded.
   * “Nothing feels heavier on my chest than the burden of unsaid words.”
   * She moves to a new hostel, hoping for a fresh start.

### **Act 2 – Rising Tension (Healing → Haunting)**

4. **A.S Becomes More Controlling**

   * He demands photos. Humna resists.
   * He retaliates by hurting her friends (small accidents escalating to real danger).
   * Stalker lines:

     * “Looks can kill…”
     * “Classic never goes out of style.”

5. **Humna’s Fight for Control**

   * Humna journals, talks to Eman, prays, tries to maintain her sanity.
   * Her inner monologues reveal her resilience:

     * “My aura gets prettier every time I heal.”

6. **The Breaking Point**

   * She tries to go to the police (“Just the beginning of my 2nd Semester.”).
   * A.S manipulates her emotionally, making her doubt herself (“The most beautiful thing about you cannot be seen…”).
   * The danger spreads beyond her — Maleeha and Eman are directly threatened.

### **Act 3 – Climax (Confrontation)**

7. **The Final Trap**

   * Humna decides to expose him, not just escape.
   * She sets boundaries, records his calls, saves messages.
   * Psychological showdown: she refuses to give him validation.

8. **The Reveal / Capture (Optional)**

   * Either A.S is caught (by police, or her own setup), OR he escapes to keep the ending chilling and unresolved.
   * Humna ends stronger — scarred but healing.
