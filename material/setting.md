Settings (Fictional, but Realistic)

You want spaces that mirror claustrophobia vs. false safety:

- Erohal University

A fictional medical university with vast lecture halls, anatomy labs, quiet libraries.

Contrasting spaces: the crowded canteen (safety in numbers) vs. isolated corridors after hours (danger).

- Old Hostel (“The First Cage”)

A cramped, slightly outdated building where Humna feels constantly watched.

Shared washrooms, dim-lit staircases, creaking fans → paranoia heightens here.

- New Hostel (“The Healing Place”)

More modern, brighter, with a small garden or rooftop.

Symbol of her attempt at freedom. But A.S still finds ways to penetrate this sanctuary.

- City Setting (for grounding)

Use fictional names for places near the hostel/university (cafés, old bookshops, tea stalls, police station).

Add a small shrine or abandoned building nearby where Humna sometimes goes to breathe — but also where she feels watched.
