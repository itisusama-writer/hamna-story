### Characters:
- Hamna Malik: Main Character
- Maleeha Malik: Sister and hostel mate.
- Eman Chaudhary: Best friend and hostel mate.
- A.S: The Secret Admirer (Stalker)

These are the base characters more will be added.

### Idea
Humna Malik Erohal university medical student. She stayed at the univesity attached hostel but shifted during the 4th semester due to being controlled by her stalker. She shifted the hostel to heal herself but his power over her not ended yet.

This is the rough idea for the reference.

### Humna lines:

[Humna acting weird something had happened to her. Her friend asked.]
- "Nothing feels heavier on my chest than the butden of unsaid words."

[A.S saw her photos on social media and he is obsessed and demanded to send him her photo. Humna did not agreed but he started physically hurting her friends.]
- "See me... Satisfied now? Done with your stupid obessions."

[The things are getting out of her hand so she decided to go to the police.]
- "Just the beginning of my 2nd Semester."

[When she enters the new hostel she said to herself.]
- "My aura gets prettier everytime I heal."

### Stalker lines: 
(some of the lines stalker used through out the novel)
- "The most beautiful thing about you can not be seen. It can not be found in your measurments or the clothes you wear. It is the deapth of your thoughts. Content of your character and the sincerity of your soul."
- "Embracing the glorious mess you are."
- "Darling. Can I be your favorite?"
(Should be in starting)
- "Aah... looks can kill."
- "Classic never goes out of style."
- "To sharp to handle..."

These are the lines that I roughly added. 

### Task
Your task is to understand all this and tell in points that what sequence should I follow. What more lines. Or If it did anything wrong, And how should I take this novel to hook the readers. Also give me some settings (Fictional) that could be used for this novel.
