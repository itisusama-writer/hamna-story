Title: "Chapter 6 - The Color of Control"
---

Humna sat at the edge of her hostel bed, fingers tightening around the dupatta draped over her orange kameez. She had chosen the color deliberately this morning... bright, defiant, a small rebellion against the heavy gray cloud that seemed to follow her everywhere.

But rebellion didn’t last long.

Her phone lit up.

*Hey baby. Good morning. Love, A.S*

Her chest tightened. The three letters taunted her, sometimes they felt like initials, sometimes like a mask. Could “A.S” even be real? Or just a decoy, a smokescreen to keep her chasing shadows?

The screen blinked again.

*Wear blue today. You look beautiful in blue.*

Humna’s jaw clenched. She had just dressed. The thought of peeling off the orange and slipping into blue made her want to scream. But deep down, she already knew the truth, defiance came at a cost. If she disobeyed, the consequences wouldn’t fall only on her. They never did.

Eman stirred on the other bed, rubbing her eyes. “You’re up early. Orange suits you, by the way.”

Humna forced a smile, but the warmth of her friend’s words was already swallowed by the chill in her veins. She rose, opened her wardrobe, and with stiff hands, pulled out a navy-blue dress.

Her reflection in the mirror stared back, silent, accusing.

Erohal University buzzed with life again. After days of eerie quiet, the campus had reopened, and students flooded the corridors, their chatter bouncing off the walls. For everyone else, the murder that had shaken the campus was already a fading nightmare. For Humna, nightmares never ended.

Maleeha waved her over near the anatomy block. “Finally, classes are back! Coffee later?”

“Yeah... coffee sounds good,” Humna murmured, though her stomach knotted.

She kept glancing over her shoulder as they walked. A blue dress, a shadow trailing her, unseen eyes. She didn’t need to see him, he was everywhere.

The café smelled of roasted beans and sugar. For a moment, Humna almost felt normal, the weight on her shoulders loosening as she laughed at something Eman said. They ordered their drinks and carried them to a corner table.

But normalcy has a cruel way of breaking.

When Humna went to the counter to pay, the cashier smiled oddly. “Mam... are you Hamna Malik? Roll number MBBS/21/143?” he recited it perfectly, like he had memorized it.

Her blood ran cold. “Yes... that’s me.”

The cashier’s smile widened. “You don’t need to pay. You have lifetime free coffee here.”

“What?” The word dropped out of her mouth, heavy.

“Yes, mam. It’s been arranged.”

“Arranged by who?” she pressed, her voice trembling.

The cashier’s eyes flickered nervously. “I’m sorry, mam. We’re not allowed to give out that information.”

Her coffee suddenly felt like poison in her hand.

The phone buzzed.

*How was the coffee, darling?*

Her heart hammered. She typed furiously:
“Why did you do this?”

The reply came instantly.

*Because I love you. Take care. Enjoy your day. Love, A.S*

Her fingers shook as she answered:
“You don’t have to do anything for me.”

And then... silence.

No reply. Not for an hour, not for the entire day. His absence was almost worse than his presence. The quiet carried weight, as if he were punishing her with withdrawal.

By the time she returned to her room, the silence was suffocating.

She stared at her phone on the desk, its black screen reflecting her anxious face. Every second stretched like hours. She wanted the next message, dreaded it, needed it.

When it didn’t come, she whispered into the empty room, words only she could hear.

“Nothing feels heavier on my chest than the burden of unsaid words.”

And she wondered if, somewhere in the shadows, he was smiling, knowing he still controlled her, whether he spoke or not.
