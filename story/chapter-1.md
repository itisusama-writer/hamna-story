Title: "Chapter 1 - Introduction"
---

Erohal University sat on the outskirts of Nooriabad, a sprawling campus of red-bricked lecture halls and crowded hostels. For most students, it was just another step toward their degrees, but for **Humna Malik**, it was the place where her life had been reshaped. She had come all the way from Mehrabad, a faraway city, carrying with her the weight of her parents’ trust, the warmth of her younger sister, and the bond of her closest friend.

Humna’s days at Erohal were filled with anatomy labs, late-night cramming, and whispered secrets in hostel corridors. Yet, despite the demands of the University, she had built her own small circle of safety. Her sister, **Maleeha Malik**, shared the same hostel wing. They argued like all sisters did, but Maleeha’s laughter was the anchor that kept Humna steady. Alongside her was **Eman Chaudhary**, her best friend since the first day of orientation. Together, the three of them carried each other through sleepless nights and exam panic.

“Humna, you didn’t eat breakfast again,” Eman scolded one morning, balancing her books in one arm.
Humna brushed her hair back, slipping on her white coat. “Classes start at eight. I don’t have time for parathas when the professors are waiting.”
Eman rolled her eyes, still tying her shoelaces. “You never have time for food. But when you faint in the dissection hall, don’t expect me to catch you.”

They laughed, a familiar rhythm of teasing that made the hostel feel less like concrete walls and more like home. For a while, everything was simple. The first semester passed in a blur of lectures, endless notes, and the kind of exhaustion that still felt worth it.

Humna often thought of her life before Erohal. In Mehrabad, she had always been the quiet one, the dependable one. But here, away from home, she felt herself changing... learning not just about bones and blood vessels but about independence.

Life at Erohal was relentless. The first semester swept by in a blur of lectures, endless diagrams sketched across dog-eared notebooks, and the sharp smell of formalin in the anatomy lab. Nights were spent huddled in the hostel corridor with friends, whispering jokes between sips of chai while their books lay abandoned nearby. Even exhaustion had its sweetness, softened by their shared laughter.

“Humna, your handwriting looks like ECG waves,” Eman teased one night as Humna struggled to finish her notes.
Humna laughed, tossing the pen aside. “That’s because my brain is flatlining.”

In those early months, everything felt ordinary. Exams came and went, their results discussed over steaming samosas in the cafeteria. Weekends slipped into movie nights on someone’s laptop, the hostel echoing with giggles and groans when the Wi-Fi cut out. Humna thrived in that rhythm. She was active on social media, posting pictures of her dorm desk cluttered with flashcards, or a candid of Eman asleep in the library, captioned with laughing emojis. She even uploaded short reels from the cafeteria, half serious, half mocking the chaos of student life.

The second semester unfolded much the same. The pressure mounted, but so did her confidence. She presented in class without her voice shaking, answered viva questions with steady eyes, and grew into the version of herself she had always wanted to be, independent, brave, and just a little more radiant than the girl who had left Mehrabad.

“My aura gets prettier every time I heal,” she once told herself in the hostel mirror after surviving another round of exams.
Maleeha, half-asleep on the bed, groaned. “Stop talking like a Vista caption.”
“Don’t listen to her,” Eman cut in. “Post it. Hashtag it. Own it.”

And Humna did. She posted without hesitation, eager to share fragments of her world with the friends and relatives who followed her from back home.

But by the middle of her third semester, small cracks appeared. They were almost invisible at first, easy to overlook. A post would go up, her smiling in the library, a plate of food in the cafeteria, and within minutes, she would delete it, claiming it “didn’t look right.” She told Eman she was being picky, that her feed needed a “cleaner aesthetic,” but even Eman noticed how her smile tightened whenever her phone buzzed.

Strangers, too, unsettled her. Once, while standing in line for chai, she caught a boy staring at her from across the courtyard. She looked away quickly, pretending not to notice, but her tea went cold in her hand. Another time, walking back from the lecture hall, she adjusted her dupatta nervously, convinced she was being followed. Maleeha teased her, saying, “You’ve become paranoid. Who’d bother stalking you when they’ve got their own exams to fail?” Humna laughed, but the sound felt thinner than before.

Her habits changed in quiet ways. She began sitting closer to the walls in the cafeteria, where fewer people passed behind her. She muted unknown accounts on Vista, stopped tagging her location, and sometimes shut her phone off altogether in the evenings. When Eman asked why, Humna shrugged. “Too many distractions. I want to focus.”

To anyone else, Humna was still the same girl: bright, determined, surrounded by friends, smiling for selfies, dreaming of her white coat and stethoscope. But in her quietest moments, a question pressed against her chest, wordless and heavy, one she couldn’t name but couldn’t ignore.

And though she didn’t know it yet, someone else had already begun naming it for her.
