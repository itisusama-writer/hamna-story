Title: "Chapter 8 - The Case"
---

It began with the light. Hamna woke one morning to a thin rectangle of sunlight that fell across her pillow like an accusation. The sun was ordinary; what made it sharp was the knowledge that someone had timed it. Someone had watched the angle of the blinds, the minute she reached for her phone, the small ritual with which she checked messages and breath and the world. For a second she told herself it was her imagination. For a second she believed she could rebuild the boundary around her life. Then the phone buzzed.

*You put the curtains wrong. You always do that when you think of hiding. Love, A.S*

The words were domestic, absurd as a hand in her room straightening a picture frame. Her fingers, which had known how to steady a stethoscope and scribble notes in the margins of anatomy texts, went numb.

She did not tell Eman. She let Maleeha, who had made her coffee because Hamna's hands had refused to make any, pass across the table a look that wanted to ask a hundred things. Hamna answered none of them. She drank the coffee the way someone drinks a glass of saltwater: because the body wanted something warm to swallow while the world came apart.

The police had taken notes when she went before, polite, tired men with chairs that creaked, and had filed her case as “harassment” with a bureaucratic flatness that felt like a legal yawn. 

“We’ll look into it,” they had said, because that was what a system with folding chairs and case numbers always said.

After the harassment thing, A.S did not stop. He escalated with an artistry that made cruelty read like craftsmanship. Texts arrived timed to her lectures, to the lull after night, to the moment she stepped under fluorescent university lights. 

Some were poems dressed in concern,the sort of lines that promised to see the beauty of her soul, and some were granular details about things only someone inside her house could know: the brand of soap on her sink, the phrase Maleeha used when she was trying not to shout, the name of the waiter in the canteen who had smiled at her last week. He punctured the small private seams of her life with a needle so fine it left no visible wound but bled her confidence dry.

“Obsession is just love that refuses to die quietly,” one message said, like a philosophy of predation.

Police filed the case as harrasment makes sense to Hamna but she knew it could create her life more difficult than before. She never knew at first that police would do such a thing, but the mess had already done.

She started sleeping with lights on and give a long look at Maleeha and Eman, because she knew what could be the consequences of the mess that had been created. She locked the room twice, then three times. She checked under the bed, in the closet, behind the wardrobe, as if the stalker were a thing shaped like a shadow and she could prod it into being seen. 

“Fear is loud, but so is my courage,” she had whispered at the mirror some nights. The mirror began to lie back.

Eman noticed the tremor in her hands that smell of disinfectant could not clean. “Hamna, talk to me,” she said one evening in the corridor, voice low, eyes quick. “You’re...” Her sentence folded into the space between them. Eman did not finish because she did not have the map for the place Hamna had become.

Hamna tried to tell Maleeha. She tried to say: I can’t. I have to breathe through the day. And Maleeha, whose temper had been as quick as her laughter since childhood, went still. She believed her at first with the fierce faith of a sister until the phone lit up between them and the text that followed made both of them look as if someone had cut out the air.

*You look thinner in the new light. The lemon smell suits you. It suits the way you try to sanitize yourself from me.*

A.S did not wait for her answer. He never did. The next message came like someone flipping a switch in the dark, quick and clinical.

*They filed it. How quaint. Paper walls for paper men. Tell them to look behind the curtains. Tell them to check the soap. Tell them to find the footprints of a ghost. I’ll wait while they look at the sky for shadows.*

Hamna read the words and felt her stomach empty in a way that had nothing to do with hunger. The way he wrote as if the police were a performance he could slow down. He knew their procedures down to the polite cadence of "we'll look into it." He had known which boxes the officers would tick and which boxes they'd ignore. He had mapped the holes in a system before she trusted it with the shape of her life.

He sent one more:

*You did the sensible thing, Hamna. You fed them the evidence like crumbs. They will argue over crumbs while I eat the kitchen. There are cameras that sleep, officers who file, men who prefer neat piles. None of them will see me.*

Maleeha and Eman were in the narrow kitchen where the light hit the counter the way a spotlight hits a performer who does not want one. Hamna looked at them and suddenly every ordinary intimacy felt dangerously small, a shared cup, a familiar joke, the careless nicknames they used. 

Her eyes moved from Maleeha’s hands to Eman’s mouth and back again, searching for some instruction that did not exist. The words A.S had sent were not just a taunt toward the police: they were a knife aimed at their faith in her choice to tell.

Eman placed a plate down as if to anchor something. “They took your statement,” she said, not a question. A fact she needed to make solid. “We were with you. We’ll go with you. We’ll...”

Maleeha interrupted, voice too small for the room. “This could get worse, Hamna. If this goes public, people will… people will say things.” Her words stumbled on the edge of reputation and fear: whispers about how she’d behaved, how she’d posted, how she’d let strangers into the geometry of her days. “They’ll say you liked the attention. They’ll say it was—” She could not find the rest.

Hamna felt it then, the old, private humiliation that bullied itself into the corners whenever something threatened her. She had not thought, until now, how much of her life she had kept behind a polite curtain because the world demanded that women protect not only their bodies but their stories. If she spoke too loudly — of the nights, of the messages, of the smell of lemon on the fourth floor that now clung to her like a witness — the universe might decide she had wanted the drama. It was an old, cruel logic: the victim recast as the performance.

She tried to say it. “They’ll say I—” Her voice broke on the word. The room moved like a ship in a slow swell; Eman’s face blurred in the motion. Maleeha reached out and squeezed her hand, and the touch was both fierce and terribly fragile.

A.S did not let them pause. The phone chimed. The new message arrived with the ease of someone replacing a page in a book he already owned.

*Oh, how they’ll whisper. They'll invent staircases where there were none. They’ll argue about your clothes, about the hour you posted that selfie, about whether you smiled too widely at a waiter months ago. People love to make order of chaos by blaming the person who was messy enough to be seen. Don’t worry. I will enjoy the court of curious mouths. Bring popcorn.*

The words were designed to hollow her. They did. Hamna felt the hollow as if someone had taken out a part of her that she had assumed permanent. Tears rose like a tide she had tried to hold back with breath and tiny, brittle promises to herself. They pooled behind her eyes and, for a moment, she imagined the lemon-scented air pressing in, compressing until even the act of breathing was a decision.

She let them fall.

They were sudden and ugly and honest. Not the quiet, private tears that she would have hidden in the bathroom mirror — these were full-bodied sobs that wracked her chest, pulled in her shoulders, and left her knees weak. Maleeha moved first, arms closing around her in a grip that said She is real and she is here and nobody gets to rearrange that fact. Eman’s hand covered Hamna’s back, fingers pressing into the spine as if to reassemble the pieces she feared losing.

Outside, the university went on with its small mercies: buses, bell chimes, the distant hum of students exchanging notes. Inside the kitchen, the three of them sat on mismatched chairs and the world reduced to three breaths and the sound of Hamna’s tears breaking against Maleeha’s shoulder.

“You can stop him,” Maleeha whispered between sobs, as if saying those words might make them true. “We can make him stop.”

Hamna wanted to believe it; she wanted to fold into it and let the two of them hold a plan like a talisman. But A.S had shown them the architecture of the thing: the police who could not reach him, the public who would not always understand, the private ways systems protected certain kinds of violence because they liked tidy narratives.

Her mind drifted, terrifyingly precise: what would they say in lectures? What would the senior who had once complimented her on a presentation say if someone else told him a version of events that painted her as reckless? What would parents whisper about late-night study routines and the photos she posted for friends? Each imagined story scraped at her like a file.

She pressed her face into Maleeha’s shoulder until the sound of her breath steadied. The crying did not stop what had happened; it only acknowledged the fact of it in the world. A.S’s messages were a pressure against her ribs, and for the first time she felt the depth of how much of herself could be catalogued by another’s appetite.

On the screen, another message glowed like a promise and a threat at once.

*I told them where to look. I told them the right stories. They’ll chase shadows while I rearrange the light. Don’t cry, Hamna. It waters my page.*

Hamna snatched the phone from the table and threw it onto the counter as if she could eject the voice from the room. It clattered, face up, screen dark for a fraction of a second, and then lit again with the next line:

*But you did well. Cry for me. It’s pretty.*

The room tightened in on her: the lemon scent, the small chipped plates, the hands that loved her. The walls had not physically moved, but the geography of the world had shifted — the spaces between trust and danger had thinned to a dangerous string. Hamna folded inward, and the three names that mattered most in her life — Hamna, Maleeha, Eman — held that thin, trembling center as if it were the only thing to be preserved.

She thought of the police papers, the stamped case number, the courtesies of men who meant well but were limited by their desks. She thought of her reputation, porous and subject to rumor. She thought of A.S, calm and distant, with a map of how to make her world smaller.

She cried until sound turned to a hush, and when the sobs slowed she sat very still and listened. The clock on the wall kept time like a metronome for the frightened. Somewhere, a phone buzzed again, and Hamna understood that the night was not merely around her; it had already climbed inside the rooms that sheltered her life.

She nodded. “Yes... all of them.”

He leaned forward. “Can I see?”

Humna unlocked her phone with shaking hands. The message list was an archive of her nightmares — each one signed the same way:
*Love, A.S.*

Tariq scrolled silently, his jaw tightening. “This man’s careful. He uses auto-deleting texts. He knows surveillance patterns. Whoever he is, he’s smart.”

Before Humna could answer, the screen lit up again.
A new message.
Short. Cold.
*So he came... Give him the phone.*

Humna froze. Her breath caught. She had never seen a message from him without the signature. No “Love, A.S.” this time — just an order.

Her pulse hammered in her ears.
Without thinking, she handed the phone to the officer.

Tariq frowned. “What is it?”
“Just... read,” she whispered.

He glanced at the screen — and his face changed. The corners of his mouth went rigid. “What the hell—”

Another message blinked in before he could finish.
*Hello, Officer Tariq Shah. So you want to find me... right?*

Tariq’s blood ran cold. His name. His *name.*
He hadn’t told it to anyone here — not even the warden. He looked around the room instinctively, like the stalker might be standing right behind them.
“How the hell does he know my name?” he muttered.

Humna’s eyes widened. “He... he shouldn’t. I didn’t tell him anything—”

Tariq’s fingers flew over the keyboard.
**Who the hell are you? And how do you know my name?**

The typing dots appeared immediately.
Then came the reply.
*I am **Adrian Saireen.***
*I know everything.*
*And I can see everything.*

The name lingered on the screen like a curse.
Humna’s breath hitched. Adrian. Adrian Saireen.
The name she had feared had none — now it did. And somehow, that made it worse.

Tariq’s voice came low and steady. “Is this the first time he’s used his name?”

“Yes,” she whispered, backing away from the table. “He’s never signed like that before. It’s always A.S. — just A.S.”

The phone buzzed again.
*Careful, officer. The girl doesn’t like being watched... yet she tells you everything I want you to hear.*
Then another:
*Step closer to her. Let’s see what you do when you realize I’m watching both of you.*

Tariq dropped the phone like it had burned him. “This isn’t just harassment anymore,” he said through clenched teeth. “This man is inside your life, Miss Malik. Inside your—”

The words broke off as the hostel lights flickered.
Once.
Twice.

Humna’s heartbeat synced with the hum of electricity. She looked toward the darkened hallway — and swore she saw movement.

“Tariq...?” she whispered.

He turned, scanning the shadows. “Stay behind me.”

The lights steadied again.
Nothing.
Just silence.

But when they looked back at the phone, another message was already waiting.
*Don’t look for me, Officer. You’re already too close.*

Then the screen went black.

---

Humna stood trembling, tears threatening again — but this time from something colder than fear.
Realization.

She had tried to escape him through confession. Through courage. Through truth.
But he was always three steps ahead.

And now, she had spoken his name.
A name she was never meant to know.
