Title: "Chapter 2 - Stalker in the Feed"
---

Hamna scrolled through Vista half-heartedly, her thumb pausing on the glossy fragments of her own life. Selfies with Maleeha, group shots with Eman, the occasional candid at the cafeteria. All so ordinary. Yet tonight, as her eyes lingered on those frozen smiles, the ordinariness cracked.

A message blinked on her screen.
*Darling, can I be your favorite? Love, A.S.*

Her heart stuttered. An unknown number. The letters A.S. hung in her mind like a blade. She whispered to herself, “Who is this A.S.?” The name felt wrong in her mouth, like a stranger trespassing in her thoughts.

Before she could show it to Maleeha, the message dissolved. Not deleted... vanished. Erased as if it had never existed. Her fingers shook when the phone chimed again.

*Why you stop using Vista? I am waiting for your posts, your photos. I am missing your pretty face.*

Hamna’s first instinct was proof. She pressed for a screenshot... blocked. She borrowed Maleeha’s phone, angled the camera, but the moment the lens caught her screen, it blackened. A void where her fear should have been captured. Hamna’s breath hitched. This wasn’t just someone texting. This was someone inside her world, writing her story before she could turn the page.

She put the phone down. Pretended nothing had happened. The day crawled by with classes and laughter, but every smile she forced hid the tremor in her chest.

That evening, her phone lit again.
*Baby... why are you ignoring me like this? You looked so pretty today. I saw you taking pictures. Post it. Make my day.*

Hamna’s fingers clenched. Her skin prickled. Someone had seen her. Today. Up close.

Still, she ignored him. She had to.

The next evening, Eman stumbled into the hostel room. Her dupatta was crooked, her eyes wet with pain. Hamna froze at the sight of her friend’s twisted ankle.

“What happened?” Hamna rushed forward.

“Someone pushed me,” Eman whispered, her voice breaking. “On the stairs. In the university. I don’t even know who.”

Maleeha gasped, lowering Eman gently onto the bed. But Hamna’s phone was already vibrating in her pocket.

Her throat closed as she read.
*Is she hurt? I didn’t push her that hard. You made me do it.*

Hamna trembled so hard she nearly dropped the phone. The room spun. She understood now, the messages weren’t harmless. They were demands. And disobedience had consequences.

With a trembling hand, she opened Vista. She uploaded her most recent picture, her face pale and eyes hollow, but smiling just enough. A mask for her stalker.

The reply came almost instantly.
*You’re looking gorgeous. Thanks.*

Hamna set the phone down, her chest rising and falling like a trapped bird’s. She whispered under her breath, words she didn’t dare say aloud to anyone else.
“See me... Satisfied now? Done with your stupid obsessions.”

*Not yet baby... See you soon. Love, A.S.*

But the silence after the message wasn’t peace. It was the kind of silence that watches you, waits for you, and never lets you go.
