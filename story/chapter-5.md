Title: "Chapter 5 - Behind the Screen"
---

The hostel room was quieter than usual. Outside, the corridors buzzed with nervous chatter, everyone still whispering about the murder in the courtyard. Hamna sat hunched over her laptop, the glow of the university website painting her face pale.

Eman shifted on her bed, scrolling her phone without focus, while Maleeha sat cross-legged on the floor, books open but untouched. The silence between them wasn’t comforting; it was suffocating, filled with things none of them dared to voice.

Hamna clicked into the *student directory* tab. Her fingers trembled on the touchpad.

“I don’t know why you’re doing this,” Maleeha muttered, not looking up. “This is just... pointless.”

Hamna didn’t answer... She didn't want to answer. She typed **A.S.** into the search bar.

The list loaded.

**Ali Shahid.**
**Adeel Shamsher.**
**Arsalan Saeed.**
**Ahmed Salman.**

Four names. Four faces staring back at her through grainy ID card photos.

Her breath quickened. “One of them. It has to be one of them.”

“Or none of them,” Eman said flatly, still scrolling. “Maybe you’re feeding into him by even searching.” Eman was actually right, but inside, she thinks Hamna is being paranoid.

Hamna swallowed. Her mouse hovered over *Ali Shahid’s* picture. A notification pinged on her phone at that exact second. Her chest tightened.

*Good morning beautiful. Love, A.S*

then another message *I have seen you recent posts on Vista... Aah... looks can kill.* but Hamna ignored she doesn't want to reply him in front of Maleeha and Eman.

Her hand jerked, knocking the laptop slightly. Eman’s head snapped up. “What happened?”

Hamna quickly turned the phone face down. “Nothing. Just spam.”

Maleeha finally looked at her. Her sister’s eyes narrowed, searching Hamna’s face for the truth. “Spam doesn’t make you pale.”

Hamna ignored her, clicking into another profile. *Arsalan Saeed, 3rd year, Surgery rotation.* Her pulse hammered.

The phone buzzed again.

*Classic never goes out of style.*

She closed her eyes, pressing her lips together. Her breath trembled out of her.

“Hamna,” Eman’s voice softened now, a rare crack in her usually sharp tone. “If you know something… you need to tell us. The police, maybe...”

“No!” Hamna snapped, louder than she intended. Both Eman and Maleeha flinched. The tension cracked through the air like a whip. She forced her voice lower. “I can’t. Not yet.” She couldn’t tell them she had already gone to the police... what good had it done? Against A.S, she was still powerless.

The message came again before her words even settled.

*Healing makes you glow... I should know, I’ve watched every flicker of you.*

She clutched the phone in both hands, her knuckles whitening.

Maleeha whispered, “Then why does it feel like someone’s right here with us?”

Hamna looked at the list of A.S names again. The faces blurred. She could feel eyes, real eyes, on her, as if from beyond the screen.

Eman’s voice cut the silence. “You think staring at those names will save you? He’s smarter than that. He’s not going to leave himself in plain sight.”

Maleeha frowned, glancing between them, confusion flickering across her face as if she sensed they knew something she didn’t. Hamna quickly shook her head at Eman, a silent plea to shut up.

The phone buzzed one last time. The message popped up, chilling her blood.

*Fear is loud... but so is your courage. Show me which will win tonight.*

Hamna’s breath hitched. She didn’t look up, didn’t move. The laptop screen glared back, four names glowing like accusations.

The phone buzzed one last time. The message popped up, chilling her blood.

Hamna’s breath hitched. She didn’t look up, didn’t move. The laptop screen glared back, four names glowing like accusations.

Her mind spun. How the hell did he always know? Every move, every click, every thought she tried to keep hidden, he was already there, watching.
