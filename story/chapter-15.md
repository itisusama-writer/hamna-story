Title: "Chapter 15 — The One Who Left"
---

The hostel corridors were unusually silent that evening. Only the hum of the flickering tube lights followed Hamna as she stepped inside, her shoes leaving faint imprints on the polished floor.

Eman looked up from her desk the moment Hamna entered.
“Where were you all this time?” she asked, her tone sharp, worried.

Hamna didn’t answer. Her face looked calm... too calm. The kind of stillness that didn’t belong to the girl who used to tremble every time her phone buzzed.
Instead, she turned to her sister.
“Maleeha, pack up. We have to go home. We have fifteen minutes.”

Eman blinked. “What? Hamna, what’s going on?”

But Hamna’s eyes didn’t even flicker toward her. She opened her wardrobe, pulling out clothes and books in quiet precision, as if each movement was rehearsed.
Maleeha stood frozen for a moment. “Why so suddenly?” she whispered.
No reply.

When the bag was full, Hamna zipped it up and slung it over her shoulder.
“I’ll be waiting for you at the gate,” she said, voice even.
Then she walked out.

Eman and Maleeha exchanged uneasy glances.
“She’s acting so weird,” Eman murmured.
Maleeha nodded, biting her lip. “She’s... not herself lately.”

Outside, the evening air was cold and sharp. Hamna stood by the gate, staring out toward the fading hills of Nooriabad. The bus lights flickered in the distance, the road that led home, to Mehrabad.

When Maleeha finally caught up, dragging her suitcase behind, Hamna turned her head slightly. A small, practiced smile curved on her lips.
“Ready?” she asked.
Maleeha nodded.

The gates of the hostel creaked open. Neither of them looked back.

The watchman, half asleep in his chair, barely noticed the way Hamna’s reflection in the glass didn’t blink when she did.

**Hours later.**
In the basement of the old Erohal building, behind the biology lab, past the locked storeroom, a dim yellow light buzzed inside a forgotten shelf.

On the highest rack, beside a jar marked *Adrian Saireen*, another jar sat quietly.
Inside it, eyes still faintly moving, was **Hamna Malik**.
Her lips twitched once, as if trying to form a word.

The glass fogged from inside.

And then... stillness.
