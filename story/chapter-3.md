Title: "Chapter 3 - The Corridor Smile"
---

The days that followed were eerily silent. No notifications, no vibrating phone tucked under her pillow, no texts signed off with *Love, A.S.*

Hamna should have felt relieved. Instead, the quiet unsettled her. She carried the silence like a shadow, always bracing for the sound of her phone, always imagining his unseen gaze.

One afternoon, after a lecture in physiology, Hamna lingered in the corridor with a classmate, Faraz. He was known for his dry wit, and for a few minutes, Hamna forgot the weight she’d been carrying.

“You really didn’t get the answer right on purpose?” Faraz asked, grinning as he held his books.

Hamna laughed lightly, her hand brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. “What makes you so sure? Maybe I just didn’t study.”

“Please, Malik, you’re the only one who actually reads the recommended chapters. The rest of us are professional skimmers.”

She shook her head, smiling despite herself. For a brief moment, it felt normal. Safe.

But the moment shattered when she reached the hostel, her phone vibrates.

A message blinked on the screen.
*I miss you baby. Love, A.S.*

Her breath caught. Her fingers trembled as another message appeared seconds later.
*Who was that guy in the corridor? I don’t like the way you smiled that time when he was talking.*

Her chest tightened. She typed quickly.
“He was just my classmate. We were just joking.”

The reply came instantly.
*Now I will joke. Love, A.S.*

She froze. The words crawled into her skin. What did that mean?

Waiting for another message, Hamna curled onto her hostel bed. Hours dragged. The phone remained silent. Exhaustion finally pinned her eyelids shut, and she slipped into uneasy sleep.

When she woke, it was late. The corridor outside hummed faintly with footsteps and muffled chatter. Hamna rubbed her eyes, still foggy, when the door creaked open.

Eman stumbled in.

Hamna sat up immediately. Eman’s face was pale, her dupatta clutched tightly in trembling hands. Her right ankle twisted awkwardly as she limped forward, and there was a sickly yellow tinge to her skin as if she’d been drained of all warmth.

“Eman!” Hamna rushed to her. “What happened? You look shaken. Tell me what happened?”

Eman’s lips trembled. Words broke apart on her tongue before they could form.

Finally, in a stuttering whisper, she said, “S... someone killed Faraz. I saw his body... in the courtyard.”

Hamna’s stomach turned. Her breath caught like a knot tightening in her throat. The words replayed, each repetition sharper than the last.

Faraz.
The corridor.
Her smile.
*Now I will joke.*

Her phone, lying silent on the bedside table, suddenly looked monstrous. She grabbed it and clicked the unknown number in her messages. It was blank, no name, no trace.

Her fingers trembled as she typed:
“I know you did it. What is your problem? What’s wrong with you? I am going to the police.”

The reply came swiftly, coldly playful:
*Aww. My baby is missing me… He didn’t even resist.*

Then another message followed like a dagger:
*Go to the police. Do whatever you wish. I am always with you baby. Love, A.S*

Hamna stared at the screen, her breath shallow. No more messages came after that. But she noticed the pattern clearly now. He always began with *Love, A.S*... and ended the same way.

Shivering, she whispered into the dark, “Every scar is a sentence my soul wrote to survive.”

She knew what she had to do. She decided she would go to the police. But it was already too late tonight. Her heart raced as she lay awake, planning for tomorrow.
