Title: "Chapter 9 — The Name That Shouldn’t Exist"
---

The morning light didn’t warm her anymore. It fell pale and colorless across the hostel floor, catching on the tear stains dried on Humna’s cheeks. She hadn’t slept, not really. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw that name again in her inbox.
*Fear is loud... but so is your courage.*
It had been courage that drove her to the police. But now, it felt like that same courage had betrayed her.

That afternoon, the warden knocked softly before stepping in.
“There’s a police officer here to speak with you. About... the harassment case.”

Humna’s stomach turned. *Not again... please, not again.*

She wiped her face quickly and stood, her limbs heavy as though gravity had chosen her for punishment.
When she reached the common room, a man in uniform was waiting... mid-forties, broad-shouldered, eyes sharp but kind.
“Miss Humna Malik?” he said. “I’m **Officer Tariq Shah**. I’m looking into your case.”

She nodded, her throat dry. “I didn’t mean for it to become a case,” she whispered. “It wasn’t supposed to...”

“Miss,” Tariq interrupted gently, “I just need to understand what’s happening. You said someone’s been messaging you. Stalking you.”

Her fingers trembled around her phone. “He’s not just messaging,” she said, voice breaking. “He knows where I am. What I’m doing. Every time I try to run, he’s already there.”

Tariq flipped open his small notepad. “Do you still have the messages?”

Humna shook her head instantly. “They vanish... seconds after I read them. Like they were never there.”

He frowned. “You’re saying they auto-delete?”

“Yes,” she said, her voice trembling. “Even screenshots don’t work. Every time I try, the screen freezes for a second, then clears like it’s protecting him.”

Tariq rubbed his temple, thinking. “That’s not a normal messaging app. Whoever he is, he’s either a hacker or...”

Before he could finish, the phone vibrated in her hand.
A new message.

*So he came... Give him the phone.*

Humna’s breath caught. For the first time, there was no “Love, A.S.” at the end, just a command. Cold. Authoritative.

She didn’t even think. She handed it to him, her hand shaking.

“What is it?” Tariq asked, his brows knitting.

“Just... read.”

He looked down at the screen. The next message appeared instantly, as though it had been waiting for his eyes.

*Hello, Tariq Shah. So you want to find me... right?*

Tariq froze. His name. Not “Sir,” not “Officer.” *Tariq Shah.* Exact. Personal.
He felt a familiar chill crawl up the back of his neck.

“How the hell does he know my name?” he muttered under his breath.

“I didn’t tell him!” Humna said, stepping back. “I swear, I didn’t!”

Tariq typed furiously:
"Who the hell are you? And how do you know my name?"

The typing bubbles appeared almost instantly, mocking, rhythmic.
Then came the reply.

*I am **Adrian Saireen.***
*I know everything... I remember everthing.*
*And I can see everything.*

Tariq’s fingers went still. His pulse spiked, his throat tightening.
The name.
He whispered it without realizing, “Adrian... Saireen...”

Humna looked at him, confused. “You know him?”

Tariq’s eyes darkened. “That’s impossible.”

“What?”

“That name... Adrian Saireen, he was a *real person.* A systems engineer. Christian. Worked with the cybercrime division years ago. He... he died.”

Humna blinked, disbelief written across her face. “Died?”

Tariq nodded slowly, the color draining from his face. “Car accident. Or at least, that’s what the file said. Burned beyond recognition.”

The phone buzzed again, cutting him off.

*Funny thing about death, Tariq...* the message read.
*You of all people should know... some names don’t stay buried.*

Tariq felt the blood drain from his hands. He remembered the way Adrian used to talk during their brief time working together, always half-smiling, half-challenging, sentences like riddles.
The rhythm. The arrogance. Even the pauses. It was the same.

“This can’t be,” Tariq whispered. “I know this pattern. This phrasing. It’s... it’s him.”

Humna’s breath hitched. “But you said he’s dead.”

Tariq’s jaw clenched. “He *is.* Or he was.”

The screen flickered again.
*I told you, Tariq. I see everything. Even the guilt you carry.*
*How’s your daughter, by the way? Still drawing stars on her bedroom wall?*

Tariq’s face went white. His hand trembled so violently he nearly dropped the phone.
Humna stared, horrified. “He... he knows your family?”

Tariq stepped back, his voice hoarse. “Nobody outside the department knew about that. Nobody.”

The phone buzzed again.
*You shouldn’t have come, Tariq. You woke the wrong ghost.*

Then, without warning, the screen went black.

“Tariq?” Humna whispered, her voice shaking.

He didn’t answer immediately. His eyes were locked on the blank screen, like it still spoke to him.

When he finally looked up, there was something haunted in his gaze.
“Miss Malik,” he said quietly, “whatever this is... it’s bigger than a stalker.”

The phone went normal.
But in that stillness, Humna knew something had changed... something irreversibly.

She had seen the name that shouldn’t exist.
And Tariq had heard the voice of a man long dead.
