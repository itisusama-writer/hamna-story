Title: "Chapter 13 — The Replica"
---

The corridor outside the hostel room was silent, too silent for the hour.
Hamna and Eman walked in, the flickering tube light humming above them like it was trying to whisper something they couldn’t hear.

Inside, **Maleeha** sat cross-legged on her bed, scrolling through her phone, earbuds dangling but not plugged in.

Hamna froze. “You... you’re here?”

Maleeha didn’t even look up. “Where else would I be?”

Eman frowned. “We just looked for you everywhere, the canteen, the lawn, even the old block.”

"I mean where were you for days... We calledd you and you didn't pick." Hamna asked.

Maleeha tilted her head, finally meeting Hamna’s eyes. “That’s funny. Because I was with you.”

The words hit like static.
Both Hamna and Eman spoke at once. “What?”

Maleeha shrugged. “Yeah. You came to my class that dady. You told me to come with you. You were acting weird... like boys do.”

The pause that followed was heavy.
Hamna blinked. “I never came to your class. Stop lying.”

Maleeha looked unbothered, scrolling again. “I’m not lying. But wait...” she squinted, like rewinding her memory. “You were messaging someone. Then you took me from the class to a luxury house. Big, fancy, silent. You were behind me the whole time. But when I reached the hostel gate, you were suddenly in front of me.”

Eman slowly sat on the edge of her bed. “What are you talking about?”

Maleeha’s voice softened, like she was remembering a dream she didn’t want to wake from.
“There was someone behind me. A guy. Black hoodie. I thought it was you again... but then I ran. I just ran to the room.”

Hamna’s stomach twisted. “Maleeha, that doesn’t make sense.”

Maleeha didn’t argue. She yawned instead, curling under her blanket. “Maybe it doesn’t. Maybe you’ll remember it better tomorrow.”

And just like that, she closed her eyes.

Eman whispered, “Do you think she’s...”

“...telling the truth?” Hamna finished.
Her heart pounded. She remembered the reflection she’d seen earlier that day... her own face moving a split second too late. The sound of footsteps following hers even when she stopped walking.

The phone on the desk buzzed.
A message.

Hamna reached for it, hesitant.
The screen flashed:

*“You can’t be everywhere at once.”*
*Love, Adrian Saireen*

The room dimmed for a moment, as if the walls themselves had exhaled.
Eman stepped closer. “Hamna... what does that mean?”

Hamna didn’t answer. She stared at her sister, asleep, peaceful, unaware... and whispered,
“It means he’s found a new way to play.”

Maleeha’s soft breathing filled the room.
The dim yellow light above her bed swayed gently, as if watching them.

Hamna and Eman exchanged a look. Neither spoke, but both moved at once, toward the desk.
Hamna’s fingers trembled slightly as she opened her laptop.

“Adrian Saireen...” she typed into the search bar.

The results loaded slowly, a handful of forgotten articles, archived blogs, and one old newspaper clipping scanned in grayscale.

Eman leaned closer. “Click that one.”

The headline read:
**CYBER SECURITY EXPERT ADRIAN SAIREEN DIES IN MYSTERIOUS CAR CHASE**

Hamna scrolled. The text blurred as her eyes moved over it:

> *Adrian Saireen (27), son of renowned scientist Dr. Joseph Saireen, was found dead after a high-speed pursuit involving unidentified vehicles. The wreckage showed no sign of collision, the car simply stopped. Police described the engine as ‘melted from the inside.’*

Hamna’s voice cracked. “Melted?”

Eman whispered, “That’s... not even possible.”

They found another article, older this time, written like an interview.
*Adrian Saireen, lead researcher in behavioral algorithms and neural mapping, claims his latest prototype can ‘imitate human emotion to perfection.’*

Hamna’s throat went dry. “Imitate?”

Eman nodded slowly. “Not feel it. Imitate it.”

They sat there, silent for a moment, the hum of the laptop filling the air.
Eman scrolled again, then stopped at a photograph, Adrian standing beside his father, both smiling, the edges of the picture warped with digital noise.

Eman read aloud, “His father, Joseph Saireen, worked in experimental consciousness transfer.” She looked up. “Hamna... this guy wasn’t just some stalker.”

Hamna closed the lid of the laptop halfway, her reflection staring back. “Then what is he?”

Eman exhaled, her voice shaking. “He *was* a person... but he’s not anymore.”

Hamna frowned. “You mean...”

“A shapeshifter,” Eman said before Hamna could finish. “Not like in those fantasy stories. He doesn’t change his skin... he changes *faces*. Patterns. Data. People.”

Hamna’s eyes darted toward Maleeha, asleep on the bed.
“Then he can be anyone.”

Eman nodded grimly. “Or anything connected.”

The laptop screen flickered once. Then twice.
A line of text appeared briefly before vanishing:

*“You finally looked me up.”*

Both of them froze.

Hamna slammed the lid shut. The room went black for a second as the light flickered again.

“Hamna...” Eman whispered, clutching her arm. “When that girl pushed me from the stairs last semester... I swear I saw *you* for a moment. Your face.”

Hamna turned slowly, eyes wide. “You told me it was dark... you said you didn’t see anyone.”

“I didn’t. But right before I fell, I heard someone say...”
Eman swallowed hard. “*Love, Adrian.*”

Silence.

Hamna’s pulse thundered in her ears. The walls of the room felt smaller, the air heavier.

“He’s copying people,” she said finally. “Using them. Maybe that’s how Maleeha saw me, because it *wasn’t* me.”

Eman nodded, her face pale. “And if he can copy you...”

Hamna whispered, finishing her thought, “He can *be* me.”

The light above them buzzed again, once, sharp and electric, before going still.
