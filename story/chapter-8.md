Title: "Chapter 8: Paper Walls"
---

It began with the light. Hamna woke one morning to a thin rectangle of sunlight that fell across her pillow like an accusation, soft and golden. For a moment, she wanted to believe it was a normal morning. But then came the vibration. Her phone.

*You should really close those curtains at night. The sun on your face makes you look too innocent to be a doctor. Love, A.S.*

Her throat dried. The curtains. The smallest habit, he noticed even that. She clutched the blanket tighter around herself, as if it could shield her from the gaze pressing invisibly against her.

Memories of the police station came rushing back. Weeks ago, she had stood there with trembling hands, reporting Faraz’s murder, clinging to hope that authority meant safety. But after dragging their feet for so long, the officers had reduced it, mockingly, into a “harassment case.” A folder stacked among thousands, gathering dust.

And A.S. knew.

*Paper walls for paper men,”* his message arrived within hours of the news. *They’ll never find me. They’ll never protect you. Their pens are weaker than my eyes.*

His texts had grown more invasive since then, dripping with a sick sweetness. He mentioned the lemon soap she kept by the sink, the way the canteen waiter always overfilled her teacup, even Maleeha’s favorite phrase... “kuch bhi nahi hota”*, mimicked back to her like a stolen whisper.

Every night, Hamna fought shadows. She slept with the lights burning, locked her door three times, checked behind curtains and under her desk. The mirror became her battlefield. Each morning she whispered:
“Fear is loud, but so is my courage.”
But her reflection trembled as much as her voice.

Eman noticed first. The way Hamna’s hands shook when holding a pen, the way her chest rose too quickly as though air itself was scarce. Maleeha saw it too, the hollow stares, the way Hamna swallowed her words like bitter pills. But neither knew the full story. Eman had glimpsed fragments about A.S., yet even she didn’t know Hamna’s police file was already a dead end.

The cruelty sharpened. A.S. didn’t just stalk her steps... he mocked her collapse. *Your officers are blind. I see your clothes before you wear them. I see the breath before it leaves your lips. And still, you cry.*

One evening, the weight broke her. The façade cracked. Hamna’s sobs tore from her chest, raw and unrestrained, echoing through the dorm walls. Maleeha rushed first, wrapping arms around her sister; then Eman knelt beside her, whispering comfort. But the storm had already broken her open.

Between gulps of air, words spilled out—messy, jagged, unstoppable.
“It’s him... it’s A.S. He never left. He sees everything, my curtains, the soap, even the way you both talk. I went to the police... I tried. They now called it harassment, just harassment, but it’s worse, it’s so much worse.”

Maleeha froze, her grip tightening. “Hamna... why didn’t you tell me? Why would you carry this alone?” Her voice cracked, half-angry, half-terrified.

“I was scared!” Hamna’s scream came through tears. “Scared he’d hurt you. Scared he’d ruin you the way he’s ruining me.”

Eman’s eyes shone, her own voice trembling. “Hamna... you mean all those messages... it was this bad? And the police already know?”

Hamna nodded, shaking. “They filed it, but it’s nothing now. He mocks them. He mocks me. He says no one can stop him. And maybe he’s right.”

Silence pressed heavy in the room, broken only by Hamna’s sobs. Maleeha kissed her sister’s damp hair, whispering, “You’re not alone anymore. Not now, not ever.”

Eman took Hamna’s hand, squeezing it tight. “If he wants to get to you, he’ll have to get through us first.”

But even as the words settled, Hamna’s stomach twisted. She knew A.S. would enjoy this... he thrived when more lives were tangled in his obsession.

Hamna’s fear spilled wider than her own body. What if they became his next canvas? What if her sister’s smile or Eman’s voice ended up ruined because she dared to resist? Her reputation, her family, her future, all of it dangled in his hands.

The phone buzzed again. Her blurred vision caught the words:

*“Don’t cry, Hamna. It waters my page. Cry for me. It’s pretty.”*

Her sobs faltered, replaced by silence. The room felt suffocating, air thick and walls too close. For the first time, Hamna realized the danger wasn’t at the gates of her life, it was already inside, woven through every moment, every breath. Her privacy was no longer hers. Her safety no longer real.

And somewhere, unseen, A.S. was smiling.
