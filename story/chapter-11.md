Title: "Chapter 11 — The Price of Getting Her Back"
---

Hamna couldn’t breathe. The walls of her dorm room pressed closer, every heartbeat echoing like a ticking clock inside her skull.

Maleeha was gone.

Her bed was still messy from last night. Her charger still plugged into the socket. The half-finished cup of tea had gone cold, but her sister was nowhere.

Hamna had screamed her name until her throat burned. She called the police, the warden, Eman, anyone who would answer. But deep down she knew.
This wasn’t random.
This was **Adrian**.

Her phone vibrated. A message.

*It’s funny, isn’t it? You cry for her the same way you cried for yourself. Did you really think I’d forgive you for humiliating me? Love, Adrian.*

Hamna’s knees buckled. She dropped to the floor, gripping her phone like it was a lifeline.
“Where is she, Adrian?” she typed, her fingers trembling. “What have you done to her?”

Three dots appeared.
Then...

*You tried to dodge me, but I always have my ways.*

“Stop it!” Hamna screamed at the screen. “Just tell me where she is!”

The reply came instantly, cruelly calm:

*“She’s safe. For now. But every good story needs a little sacrifice, don’t you think?”*

Hamna’s vision blurred. Her stomach twisted. She clutched her head, rocking back and forth.
Eman burst into the room. “Hamna! What happened?”

“He took her,” Hamna whispered. “He took Maleeha. He’s punishing me for the harassment case.”

Eman froze. “We’ll go to the police...”

“They won’t help!” Hamna snapped. “They think I’m unstable! They said he’s just *‘a troll, a disturbed admirer’.* But he’s not. He’s real. He’s here.”

The phone buzzed again. Another message.

*You should’ve kept your mouth shut. You should’ve smiled, pretended nothing happened when I killed Faraz.*
*Now look what your truth cost you.*

Eman grabbed the phone. “Don’t read these, Hamna...”

But Hamna tore it back. “No. He wants me to see. He wants me to *feel* it.”

She typed furiously:
“Give her back. I’ll do anything. You want me? Fine. Take me. Just leave her out of this.”

There was a pause. Long enough to make her hope. Then...

*That’s my girl.*
*You always knew the price.*
*Meet me where it all started... the courtyard under your window. Midnight.*
*Love, Adrian.*

Hamna’s chest caved in. The same courtyard where she first got the message for her Vista post.
Eman’s eyes widened. “You’re not going there.”

“I have to,” Hamna whispered. “If she’s still alive, he’ll kill her if I don’t.”

“Hamna, please...”

“I’m already dead to him. The only thing left to lose is her.”

The clock struck midnight.

Hamna stepped into the courtyard, the night heavy with rain. Her heart pounded with every step. The lamps flickered weakly, throwing broken light on the wet tiles.

She whispered, “Maleeha...?”

No answer. Only the wind.

Then... her phone lit up one last time.

She turned in circles, scanning the shadows. “Where is she, Adrian?!”

And then she froze.

He was there.

For the first time, she saw him, not a text, not a voice in her head, but a body.
A boy, no older than twenty, standing at the far end of the courtyard. Rain ran down his black hoodie, dripping from the edges of the white mask that hid half his face. His eyes, cold, gleaming with amusement, locked on hers.

Hamna’s breath hitched. She took a step back, trembling. “You... you’re real.”

Adrian tilted his head, just slightly, like studying a piece of art.
“Disappointed?” he said softly, voice muffled through the mask. “You imagined a monster. I’m just the boy you ignored.”

She could barely stand. Every nightmare, every message, every whisper of Love, Adrian had built up to this, a living nightmare staring back at her.

“Where is Maleeha?” she demanded.

He smiled beneath the mask; she could hear it in his tone.

“You can have her back, Hamna.”
“But healing comes with a cost.”
“You said you wanted to move on. Let’s see if you can, without her.”

Something shifted behind the trees, a silhouette, small, familiar. Maleeha’s bracelet flashed in the dim light.

Hamna ran forward, but a voice stopped her cold.

“Choose wisely.”
“Her freedom... or your peace.”

Maleeha’s voice, faint, broken, called her name once before the night swallowed everything.

Hamna dropped to her knees, the rain mixing with her tears.

She screamed into the empty dark. “You win, Adrian! You always win!”

But there was no reply. Only the sound of her own sobs echoing through the courtyard where her nightmare had begun, and would never truly end.

He began walking toward her, slow, deliberate steps echoing against the wet courtyard tiles.

Hamna couldn’t move.
Every breath scraped her throat raw. The rain was cold, but her skin burned. The mask gleamed faintly under the flickering streetlight, his shadow stretching longer with every step.

“Don’t come closer,” she whispered, though her voice shook too much to sound like a threat.

Adrian stopped just a few feet away. The curve of his mouth, the faint smirk beneath that mask, made her stomach twist.
He raised a gloved hand and brushed a strand of wet hair from her face, not touching her, just hovering there.

“Do you feel that?” he murmured. “The fear that never left you. That’s what I wanted to see again.”

Before she could react—

A shadow lunged from behind him.
**Eman.**

With one swift motion, she drove a syringe into Adrian’s neck.

He spun, snarling, but his movements faltered almost instantly. His hand reached for her throat, then dropped midair.

Eman stepped back, breathing hard.
“This is what doctors do,” she said coldly, voice trembling with adrenaline. “If you act bad.”

Adrian’s knees gave out. The syringe slipped from his skin as his body hit the ground, lifeless, face half-hidden in the puddles reflecting the courtyard lights.

Hamna stared, heart hammering, disbelief painted across her face.
“He’s... he’s out?”

Eman wiped the rain from her face. “Anesthetic. Not enough to kill him, just to stop him. We need to call...”
