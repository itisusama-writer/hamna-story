Title: "Chapter 14 — The Quiet Room"
---

The university corridors buzzed with the usual afternoon noise, laughter, footsteps, a few arguments over project marks.
Hamna walked alone, clutching her notebook close to her chest. Her mind still drifted to last night’s dream, the same flicker of a face she couldn’t place, the same whisper: *“You shouldn’t have answered him.”*

She brushed it off.

Outside, the autumn light stretched long across the courtyard. The hostel was just a five-minute walk away. She turned left, head down, trying to ignore the ache behind her eyes that had been there for days.

Then she heard her name.

“Hamna!”

Eman came running from across the road, slightly out of breath, clutching her phone. Her tone was sharp, urgent.
“Come. I got a lead... come with me!”

Hamna frowned. “Lead? About who?”

“No time to explain.” Eman grabbed her wrist. “Trust me.”

The firmness in her voice felt unfamiliar, almost commanding. Still, Hamna followed, confusion mixing with a strange sense of relief. Eman *finally* had something. Maybe this was about A.S., maybe it would end all of it.

They stepped through the university gates, into the stretch of empty road behind the parking lot. The breeze carried the faint smell of gasoline and dust.
“Eman, where are we going?” Hamna asked again.

Eman didn’t answer. Her grip tightened.

Something in Hamna’s gut twisted. “You’re scaring me.”

That’s when she saw it, the small white cloth in Eman’s hand.
Before Hamna could move, it pressed against her mouth.

The world folded into itself.
Her heartbeat slammed in her ears.
The sky turned white, then black.

When Hamna’s world came back, it did so in a harsh, fluorescent cut.

The stretcher was cold beneath her. Every light in the room seemed fixed to the same merciless angle, washing the walls in clinical white. The straps across her wrists hummed with the smell of antiseptic and something colder, the faint, sterile scent of long-preserved things.

She tried to remember how she had gotten here. The answer arrived before her memory did: the door opened and a shadow stepped into the light, tall and composed.

He smiled, the same patient tilt of mouth that had haunted her messages, the same dangerous softness behind the sound of his voice. He moved like someone assured of an audience.

“Welcome home, Hamna,” he said. His voice was even, almost conversational, as if he were greeting a guest at the door rather than someone bound to a metal slab.

Her throat closed. Her tongue felt like a foreign object. She forced air in and out and realized, with a cold clarity that had nothing to do with the straps, that she could not form words that reached him.

He stepped closer, hands behind his back. His gaze slid to a bank of glass cabinets arranged along the wall, a tidy row of jars and canisters, each sealed, each labeled in a neat hand. The room smelled of preservatives and wax and the quiet of things that would not change.

He touched one label as if reading a grocery list: “Hamna Malik.”

Hamna’s vision snagged on the glass beside it. She could not pull her eyes away. Through the jar’s curved face something sat, still, arranged, held in liquid that caught the light. The thing inside did not move. It was a presence shaped like a person’s head: hair settled, features set, eyes closed as if in sleep. There was an impossible intimacy to the way the face faced outward, as if it had been posed to be seen. The label beneath it read her name in the same ink as the others.

Next to her jar, another container waited. The label on the second read, simply: “A. Saireen.”

The man, Adrian, tilted his head toward the two jars, and for the first time his smile widened in something that looked like pride. He spoke softly, with the chilly patience of someone explaining the rules of a favored experiment.

“You didn’t think I would leave anything to chance, did you?” His eyes traveled over her, clinical, assessing. “Some things must be preserved.”

Sound failed Hamna altogether. She slid her gaze from the jars back to him, to the gentle, remorseless way his fingers ghosted once over the glass. In the reflection of the jar, her own face — pale, blurred by condensation, bound to metal — stared back at her. Not the eyes she had known, not the breath that had lived in her bones.

The lights above floated and steadied. A distant machine gave a single, indifferent beep.

Outside the room, somewhere beyond the corridor and the gates she had walked through hours before, life continued in ordinary rhythms. Inside, the glass kept its secrets.

Adrian straightened. “Now we begin,” he said.

Hamna felt nothing where panic should have been; instead there was a slow, spreading ice that made the world implausible. The jars occupied the center of everything like altars — small and final. The inked names looked like verdicts.

She tried to move — to scream, to lash, to claw — but the straps and the quiet and the glass worked together to keep the impossible truth intact: the person in the jar with her name on it was not only a relic. It was proof.

He turned his back to the shelf and faced her full on, expression smooth and satisfied as if admiring his handiwork. The room closed in, each sound magnified: the tick of cooling metal, the rustle of his coat, the slight rasp of his breath.

“Sleep now,” he said, and the words were a benediction and a verdict at once.

Hamna’s last coherent thought, if thought is what it could be called, was of her sister’s laugh, a single bright thing that belonged to a life that suddenly felt impossibly distant.

The monitor by the stretcher registered a flat, steady line. The room’s light flattened the features of every face, living or preserved. Outside the glass, the jars sat like witness stones, their labels simple and absolute.

“Hamna Malik,” the label said.

“A. Saireen,” the next one answered.

And somewhere between the two clean black inks, the room kept its silence.
