Title: "Chapter 4 — Blood on the Courtyard"
---

Erohal University was eerily quiet. The campus had been shut down for days after the murder, yet the silence carried a strange weight. Hamna slipped on her sandals, clutching her bag to her chest. Eman and Maleeha were still asleep in the cramped hostel room, the rhythmic sound of their breathing making her hesitate for a moment. For a fleeting second, she thought of waking them... telling them where she was going, asking for courage, but she pushed the thought away. The less they knew, the safer they might be.

She tiptoed out. The corridor smelled faintly of stale disinfectant, but the courtyard outside still smelled like iron. When she crossed it, her eyes darted to the far end where the incident had taken place. The police tape fluttered in the soft morning breeze, and though no body remained, she could still see the dark, dried stains on the concrete, ghostly evidence of a crime that refused to be forgotten.

Her stomach twisted. That was where Faraz’s laughter had been cut short. Where her stalker’s rage had spilled into blood.

She shuddered and quickened her pace toward the exit.

The police station looked less intimidating from the outside than it felt inside. The dull hum of ceiling fans mixed with the smell of old paper and dust. Hamna stood in front of the counter, feeling like her own heart might betray her by thudding too loudly.

The officer behind the desk glanced at her, unimpressed. “Yes, miss?”

She swallowed hard. “I want to report something. About the murder in Erohal University.”

He leaned back in his chair, pen in hand. “Your name?”

“Hamna Malik.”

“Student?”

“Yes.”

“Go on.”

Her throat tightened, but she forced the words out. “Sir, I know who did it. He messages me all the time. I was talking to my friend Faraz... I smiled at him, and my stalker... he got angry. He killed him. He hurts people if I don’t obey him.”

The officer stopped writing, his brow creasing. “You’re saying someone threatened you through messages?”

“Yes,” Hamna said, clenching her fists. “He’s been watching me for months. He knows everything about me. Where I go, who I talk to. He’s always there.”

Another officer, older and broader, stepped forward, arms crossed. “Do you have evidence of these messages?”

Hamna’s lips parted, but nothing came. “I... they’re gone. Deleted. There was an unknown number before but now... it disappeared. He erases them somehow. But it’s real. I swear it’s real.”

The older officer tilted his head slightly, voice calm but patronizing. “Miss Malik, you understand how this sounds? A stranger with no number, no screenshots, no record? Do you see why this is difficult to believe?”

Tears stung her eyes. “I’m not making this up. He killed someone. He could hurt more people. Please.”

The younger officer sighed, scribbling lazily on a notepad. “We’ll file a note of your complaint, but without something tangible, there’s nothing actionable. You’re suggesting someone you can’t prove exists.”

Hamna’s voice cracked, desperation bleeding into it. “But he’s going to hurt someone else. He said so... he always says so. Every time I ignore him, something happens.”

For a moment, silence hung heavy in the room. The older officer softened his tone. “Miss, we are investigating the murder. If you remember anything concrete... numbers, calls, photos... bring them. Until then, all we can do is note your statement.”

It felt like the walls closed in around her. The words she had carried like stones in her chest were dismissed, written off as hysteria. She nodded stiffly, gathering her bag. Her legs were heavy as she walked out of the station, disappointment pressing down with every step.

Her phone buzzed the second she stepped into the sunlight.

*Hey baby, Good Morning. Love, A.S*

The bile rose in her throat. Another message appeared almost instantly:

*What did the police say?... You sad... right?*

Her breath caught. She typed furiously, hands trembling. “Why are you doing this? Stop it.”

The reply came cold, deliberate:

*Because of you... you are mine.*

“I’m not yours. Just shut up.”

The next message froze her where she stood:

*I have to tell you something... You forgot to lock the door. Be careful, darling.*

Hamna’s body went cold. She saw the moment in her mind again, her sandals slipping silently on the floor, her hand on the doorknob, the small click she had *not* heard when she left.

Eman. Maleeha.

Her hostel was at least fifteen minutes away, maybe twenty if she ran. Even if she called, neither of them kept their phones beside them when they slept. There was no way to warn them in time.

Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, her chest constricting with panic. Finally, she typed with a sick weight in her stomach:

“Okay... I am yours. Please don’t hurt them.”

The message sent, but the silence that followed was worse than the buzzing. It meant he was watching. It meant he was near.

And it meant she had just given him what he wanted.

Her phone vibrated again.

*Good girl...*

A pause, then another message came.

*See how easy it is when you listen? Don’t worry, they’re safe... for now. But remember, darling,  doors can be locked again... and unlocked again. Anytime I wish. Love, A.S*

Hamna’s hands shook so violently she nearly dropped the phone. For the first time, she realized the truth: there was no safety in walls, locks, or distance.

There was only him.
