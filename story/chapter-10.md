Title: "Chapter 10 — The Return of Adrian"
---

Tariq’s words still echoed in her mind.
“Sorry, ma’am. It was our mistake. There is no harassment case—”

He didn’t finish.
He turned and walked away, avoiding her eyes, leaving behind the smell of burnt coffee and paperwork. Hamna didn’t stop him. She knew. This wasn’t about *her* anymore... it was about his daughter, about something the department didn’t want to reopen.

But deep down, Hamna could feel it.
The case might have been closed, but the nightmare wasn’t.

The next morning began like any other, pale sunlight creeping into the hostel room, Eman still asleep, Maleeha humming while folding her clothes. Hamna brushed her hair in silence, half-listening to the morning chatter from the corridor.

When her phone buzzed, she almost ignored it.
Then she saw the name.

*Good morning, darling. Love, Adrian.*

She froze.
The breath left her body. Her hand trembled slightly.

Adrian.

Not *A.S.*
Not the faceless initials that had haunted her for months.
Now, it had a name, and that somehow made it worse.

Her lips parted, and before she could stop herself, she typed back:

“Are you really dead?”

For a few seconds, the typing dots blinked.
Then came the reply.

“Dead? Darling, do I sound dead to you?”

Hamna swallowed hard.

“The police said you were gone.”

*Oh, yes. The police.*
*Your brave heroes of Nooriabad.*

The next message came before she could respond.

*I liked how you ran to them. How you cried in that little white room, telling them about me.*
*You thought they could save you.*

Her pulse raced. Her fingers hovered over the screen.

“They *can*,” she wrote, trying to sound steady. “They can find you this time.”

*Find me?*
*Hamna, they don’t even believe you exist anymore. You’re just a case number they closed. A story no one reads.*

Her throat tightened. She looked around the room, at Maleeha’s bed, the open wardrobe, the sunlight cutting through the curtains. Everything looked normal. *Too* normal.

“Why are you doing this?” she wrote.

*Because you look beautiful when you’re trying to be brave.*
*And because I missed our mornings.*

Hamna dropped the phone on her bed and stepped back, heart hammering.

The screen lit up again.

*Don’t be scared. I’ve been good.*
*No more games with the police.*
*But...*

She waited.
One minute. Then another.

*I have a surprise for you. Love, Adrian.*

Her heart sank. She knew it was the last message.
The same eerie finality as before, when he disappeared for weeks, only to return stronger.

That evening, Maleeha didn’t come back to the hostel.
At first, Eman shrugged it off. “Maybe she’s still at the library,” she said, scrolling on her phone. But when it got dark and the warden began her rounds, worry started to creep in.

Hamna dialed Maleeha’s number once. Twice. Then again.
Each time, it rang, then clicked silent.

Eman tried next, pacing the hallway. “She always answers me. Always.”

Hamna’s voice cracked. “She said she was going to the café near the old courtyard, right?”

Eman nodded. “Yeah, before sunset.”

They looked at each other — the same realization forming in both of their eyes.

Hamna whispered, “He said he had a surprise.”

Eman’s phone slipped from her hand, hitting the floor.

And the night in Nooriabad suddenly felt colder than it should have been.
