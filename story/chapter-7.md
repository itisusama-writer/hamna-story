Title: "Chapter 7 – The Return"
---

Two days.

It had been two full days since A.S last sent a message. The silence should have been a blessing, but for Hamna it felt wrong, like an empty corridor where you *know* someone is hiding, waiting, but never stepping out. She told herself it was relief, but at night, when she pressed her phone under her pillow, she realized she had grown used to his constant presence. Silence wasn’t freedom. It was just... suspense.

During those two days, the hostel itself had tightened like a noose. The warden’s eyes seemed to follow every step, her voice sharp whenever she saw the girls whispering or sneaking to the gate.
“No calling to the boys,” she barked one evening, catching two seniors loitering outside with their phones. The younger girls whispered complaints in the hallways, but Hamna only felt the rules as one more layer of prison bars around her.

On the third morning, her screen lit up again.

*Hey baby. I missed you. Love, A.S.*

Her chest froze. Her fingers trembled. Then... another notification. A video.

“What the fuck...” she whispered as she opened it.

The screen showed her, Eman, and Maleeha in their room, laughing, twirling, dancing to a random song just to shake off exam stress. Nothing indecent, nothing wrong... but intimate, private. A moment that wasn’t for anyone else’s eyes.

Her throat went dry.
“How! how did you...?”

Another text arrived before she could breathe.

*Your moves are so smooth.*

Hamna staggered back, gripping her bed frame, her pulse hammering. The thought struck her like lightning: what if her family saw this? What if the university saw? The clip was harmless, but in their world, even harmless could burn her life to ashes.

She typed with frantic fingers:
“Please delete this. Please.”

No reply. Seconds stretched into years.

Her mind spiraled: the warden, the faculty, her parents, how easily her reputation could shatter. Panic overtook reason. She typed again:
“Delete it please... I’m yours, right?”

The reply came almost instantly.

*Obviously, baby.*

Her vision blurred with anger and fear.
“If you post this or show anyone, it will destroy me. And if you hurt something that’s yours... it will hurt you too.”

There was a pause. Then, slowly, the dots of typing appeared.

*... You have a point. Don’t worry. It’s for me. I won’t show it to anyone.*

Hamna’s knees gave out as relief and dread tangled inside her. She typed one last word.
“Thanks.”

His reply landed like a nail hammered into her chest.

*Okay... Bye. Take care. See you next time. Love, A.S.*

The silence returned, but this time it wasn’t suspense. It was a trap closing in.
