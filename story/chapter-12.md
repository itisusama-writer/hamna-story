Title: "Chapter 12 — The Room Behind the Hostel"
---

The night hung heavy with the smell of rain and iron.

Hamna’s fingers trembled as she pressed the door shut, locking the rusted handle from the inside. The abandoned room behind the hostel hadn’t been opened in months, maybe years. Dust coated the air thick enough to choke on, and the single window was cracked like an old scar.

Eman dropped to her knees beside Adrian’s body. “He’s still breathing,” she whispered. “But his pulse is weak.”

Hamna exhaled shakily. “We couldn’t take him inside. If someone sees us...”

“They’ll think we attacked him,” Eman finished. “And considering our luck, they’ll probably believe it.”

They exchanged a quick, frightened glance. There were no ropes, no cords, nothing but what they wore. Without speaking, Hamna slipped off her dupatta and tore it into long strips while Eman did the same. The soft fabric twisted between their trembling fingers as they bound Adrian’s hands and ankles, careful but firm.

It wasn’t out of cruelty, it was fear. Fear of what he might do when he woke up. Fear of who he might be.

They shared a hollow laugh, the kind that didn’t sound human.

Hamna sat beside the unconscious figure, staring at the faint rise and fall of his chest. Adrian. The man who appeared out of nowhere. The one who had written *Love, Adrian* at the end of his messages before the nightmare began.

Her phone buzzed again. The same number.
*You are doing a big mistake. Leave him alone.*

Hamna froze.
“He’s unconscious,” she whispered. “He couldn’t have sent that.”

Eman looked up, her eyes narrowing. “Then who did?”

Hamna didn’t answer. She couldn’t. Her stomach twisted into knots as the thought crawled in, maybe A.S wasn’t just one person. Maybe it was a *network*. Or worse... maybe it was something that lived beyond logic, beyond one name.

The dim light from her phone screen flickered across Adrian’s face. He looked peaceful, almost innocent. The same man who’d terrorized her through texts. The same man she thought was dead.

“Hamna,” Eman’s voice softened. “What if... what if this isn’t him?”

Hamna’s throat went dry. “You mean someone else used his name?”

“Or someone made him use it.”

Silence swallowed the room. Outside, the rain had turned into a storm, thunder growling against the hostel walls like something alive. Hamna’s mind drifted back to every message, every whisper that followed her through hallways. *You can’t run from what you don’t understand.*

She wiped a tear that had escaped without permission.
“Eman... what if we’re part of something we don’t even see?”

Eman’s hand brushed hers. “Then we find out before it finds us.”

The storm had calmed outside, but the air inside the abandoned room still felt electric.

Hamna jerked awake at the sound of movement. Eman was already on her feet, clutching a broken metal pipe like a weapon. Adrian’s head turned slowly, the sound of his restraints creaking as he tested them.

His eyes fluttered open. Then he smiled.
Not a grateful smile. Not a human one.

“Oh... this is cute,” he drawled, his voice low and rough. “Tied up with dupattas. Creative.”

Eman stepped closer and yanked the mask off his face. His expression twisted into something between amusement and hunger.

“Who are you?” she demanded.

Adrian tilted his head, eyes glinting in the half-light. “Oh... I remember you. You were the one who screamed before you fell down the stairs. How’s your ankle now?”

Eman’s nostrils flared. “You just shut up.”

He chuckled, deep and unhurried. “Temper. I like that.”

Hamna crossed her arms, her voice trembling but sharp. “Enough games. Who *are* you?”

He looked straight at her and said, with perfect calm, “I am... Adrian Saireen.”

Hamna’s jaw tightened. “You can’t be. Adrian’s dead.”

“Dead?” He grinned wider. “That’s such a human word.”

Eman scoffed. “If you’re really him, then explain this...” she snatched Hamna’s phone and waved it in front of him. “She’s still getting messages. *You* can’t send those while tied like a scared goat.”

Adrian leaned back, smirking. “Who said I can’t?”

The phone buzzed instantly.
Hamna glanced down. A new message appeared.

*Darling... I never needed hands to reach you.*
*Love, Adrian.*

Hamna’s breath hitched. “What the hell...”

Eman’s sarcasm barely hid her fear. “Oh great, now ghosts have Wi-Fi.”

Adrian laughed, soft, but it vibrated through the air like a whisper inside their bones. “You both still don’t get it, do you?”

Hamna stepped back. “You’re not real.”

He tilted his head, that crooked grin returning. “Then how come you’re shaking?”

Eman raised the pipe higher. “Try me.”

“Oh, I don’t fight,” he said, stretching as the fabric around his wrists began to smoke. “I *unfold*.”

The dupattas burned away soundlessly. He stood up, brushing off the ashes, eyes gleaming in a way no human’s should.

Eman stumbled backward. “How did you...”

He didn’t answer. He simply walked toward the door.

“Stop!” Hamna shouted.

Adrian didn’t even look back. His hand never touched the handle. He just kept walking, and passed straight *through* the metal door as if it were mist.

For a long moment, there was nothing. No sound but the dripping of rain through the ceiling cracks.

Eman’s voice finally broke the silence. “So... you saw that too, right?”

Hamna nodded slowly, staring at the door. “Yeah.”

“Good.” Eman exhaled shakily. “Because if you hadn’t, I was seriously about to check myself into a psych ward.”

Hamna looked down at her still-buzzing phone.
A new message blinked on screen.

*You shouldn’t have tied me.*
*Now we’re even.*
*Love, Adrian Saireen.*
