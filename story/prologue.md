Title: "Prologue"

*Salaam, my darling… It’s been a long time. Haven’t had the pleasure of seeing this beauty… Love, A.S.*

Unknown number.

“No. No. No. Not again.” Hamna’s knees give. The hostel mattress coughs dust as she falls onto it, fingers pressed to her temples. “How did he get my new number?”

"I changed everything. The way I dress. The SIM. The entire hostel block. I even changed how I walk... Still, he finds me." Hamna's mind got stuck in thoughts.

The tube light buzzes. The curtain breathes with the night air. Somewhere beyond the hostel gate, the city mumbles... a scooter throttles, a gate chain scrapes metal.

Her phone vibrates again.

Typing...

Stops.

Typing...

Stops.

She paces the narrow room until the floor knows her steps. Her hands won’t steady. Sweat beads behind her knees. She swallows and tastes iron.

The door clicks. Maleeha slips in, drops a bag on the other bed, and freezes when she sees her. “Apa...?”

“Nothing.” Too fast. Too bright. “Everything’s fine.”

A ping. The sound is a needle.

*Blue suits you.*

Hamna looks down. The scarf at her throat is blue. Not just blue... the exact blue. She jerks for the curtains and yanks them shut. The fabric snags, comes half off the rod.

Another ping.

*Too late.*

A photo arrives.

It’s their room. Right now. The half-fallen curtain. The two beds. The scuff on the left wall shaped like a thumbprint. Hamna in frame, mid-reach, mouth parted. Over her shoulder, Maleeha is a soft blur.

No filter. No time.

The caption: Smile.

Her lungs forget how.

Maleeha crosses the room, small palms warm on Hamna’s shaking forearms. “Apa, who is that?”

“Spam.” The lie is thin, almost audible. “Stay away from the window.”

Ping.

*Tell her to put on slippers. The floor is dirty.*

Maleeha glances at her bare feet, then at the phone.

“Put them on,” Hamna whispers. She knows if she disobeys, the punishment will come in ways she cannot protect Maleeha from.

A hallway voice bounces past their door... someone laughing too loud, someone shushing. The ceiling fan ticks like a metronome for panic. Hamna slides the bolt. It’s a cheap slide. The door is a question waiting for an answer.

Ping.

*Don’t lock me out.*

The doorknob gives the smallest test. A careful rattle, once, like a stranger learning a new language.

Maleeha startles. “Apa? Who is...”

“Maintenance,” Hamna says, and her voice doesn’t belong to her. “They do checks.”

“Since when at this time?”

Maleeha’s fingers knot in the blue scarf. “Apa, please tell me.”

The phone hums against her palm again. A final message lands and waits like a mouth at her ear.

*Nice room, Hamna. Better than 207. Love, A.S.*
